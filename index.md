## Introduction

The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) provides an international
forum for collaboration between industry, disability organizations,
accessibility researchers, government, and others interested in web
accessibility.

We encourage individuals and organizations around the world to
participate in activities that help improve accessibility of the web.
Some of the many ways that you can participate in WAI described below
range from volunteering to implement, promote, and review guidelines; to
occasional participation in an interest group; to dedicated
participation in a working group.

**If you have any questions about getting involved with WAI or would
like more information, please contact Shawn at +1-617-395-7664 or
<shawn@w3.org>.**

## Participating in Guidelines and Groups

See [**How WAI Develops Accessibility Guidelines through the W3C
Process: Milestones and Opportunities to
Contribute**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/w3c-process.php) to learn how
WAI works through a process designed to:

-   ensure broad community input, and
-   encourage consensus development.

### Reviewing Guidelines and Documents

WAI welcomes comments on documents at any time. Comments are handled
differently depending on the stage of document development. See the
["Feedback on Specific Documents" section of Contacting
WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/contacts#documents) for where to send
comments.

One of the best times to comment on developing documents is during a
formal period for public review. Calls for review of WAI documents are
announced on the [WAI Interest Group](/WAI/IG/) mailing list, [W3C\_WAI
on Twitter](http://twitter.com/w3c_wai), [WAI Highlights RSS
feed](/WAI/highlights/about-rss), and the [WAI home page](/WAI/).

### Submitting Techniques for Implementing Guidelines

WAI's Web accessibility guidelines have associated Techniques documents
that tell you how to meet the guidelines, such as [Techniques for WCAG
2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/). You can submit ideas for new
or updated techniques. There is a [form for submitting WCAG 2.0
Techniques](http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/TECHS-SUBMIT/). To submit
techniques for other guidelines, contact the Working Group's [Team
Contact](contacts.html#team).

### Participating in Interest Groups

The [WAI Interest Group (WAI IG)](/WAI/IG) is for general discussion and
feedback on all areas of WAI's work. Most of the interaction within WAI
IG is through the public mailing list.

### Participating in Working Groups

Anyone can join a WAI Working Group public mailing list, or read the
public list archives.

There are specific criteria for formally joining Working Groups,
including requirements for participation and contribution. See the
Working Group pages below to find what group best fits your interests,
and to get information on participation and links to the mailing list
archives.

-   [ARIA Working
    Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/ "link to ARIA WG home page")
    develops a suite of Accessible Rich Internet Applications resources,
    and accessible APIs and mappings.
-   [[Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working
    Group]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/)
    reviews and comments on support for accessibility throughout W3C's
    other working groups.
-   [Education and Outreach Working Group](/WAI/EO) develops awareness,
    training, and implementation resources supporting Web accessibility.
-   [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](/WAI/GL)
    develops guidelines for Web pages, Web applications, and other Web
    content.

## Sponsoring WAI

WAI's work is supported in part by sponsorship from industry,
disability, and government organizations interested in contributing to
WAI's efforts to make the Web more accessible. Please see the list of
current sponsors on the [WAI home page](/WAI/), and [Sponsoring
WAI](Sponsor) for more information on WAI sponsorship.

## Promoting and Implementing Web Accessibility

### Promoting Awareness

-   Tell people about WAI and web accessibility.
-   Link to [WAI's home page](/WAI) and other relevant resources,
    including [Finding Your WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/yourWAI)
    (shortened link: [bit.ly/yourWAI](http://bit.ly/yourWAI)).
-   Cover web accessibility in [presentations and
    training](http://www.w3.org/WAI/train) to web developers, designers,
    managers, and others.
-   Put a [WCAG logo](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2-Conformance.html) on
    your website if it meets WCAG 2.0.

### Implementing Guidelines

-   Use the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
    (WCAG)]({{ "/standards-guidelines/wcag/" | relative_url }}) documents to help make your website
    accessible.
-   If you develop authoring tools—any software or service that people
    use to create or modify Web content, including content management
    systems—implement the [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
    (ATAG)]({{ "/standards-guidelines/atag/" | relative_url }}).
-   If you develop Web browsers, media players, assistive technologies,
    or other user agents—implement the [User Agent Accessibility
    Guidelines (UAAG)]({{ "/standards-guidelines/uaag/" | relative_url }}).

### Encouraging Accessibility

-   [Encourage authoring tools](/WAI/impl/software) to meet
    [ATAG]({{ "/standards-guidelines/atag/" | relative_url }}) by directly contacting
    vendors and requesting increased accessibility support in future
    versions, and by purchasing tools that provide the best support for
    accessibility.
-   Encourage Web browsers, media players, assistive technologies, and
    other user agents to meet
    [UAAG]({{ "/standards-guidelines/uaag/" | relative_url }}).
-   Encourage organizations to [adopt an accessibility
    policy](/WAI/impl/pol) for their organization that defines their
    commitment to Web accessibility.
-   Encourage websites to be accessible, for example, provide [feedback
    on inaccessible websites and inaccessible Web products
    carefully](http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/inaccessible.html); it is
    usually more productive to start with a positive encouraging tone,
    rather than a negative critical tone.
